Ideal work order:
In StarCraft there are 3 factions with their own units, we’re going to implement the Terran first and then move on to the others after most of the work is done.

[ ] Decide on which approach we’re going with.
[ ] Draw out the UML diagrams, flesh out all the methods and classes needed. (Terran)
[ ] Create bases.
[ ] Rudimentary GUI, implement GUI elements for every following step.
[ ] Create resource row.
[ ] AI
[ ] Get workers in. (Terran)
[ ] Create attack row.
[ ] Get 1 attacking unit in that can satisfy the win condition. (Terran)

Bare minimum achieved­­­

[ ] Create defense row.
[ ] Get attacking and defending to work.

­Foundation completed­­­

[ ] Add in more units with different stats (Terran)
[ ] Add an effect for 1 unit or 1 spell card.
[ ] Continue to add effects or spell cards one­by­one with testing until satisfied.
[ ] Have a section of rules and tips for players.

Can now be proud of work and show off to friends­­­

[ ] Protoss units
[ ] Zerg units
[ ] Make the GUI look presentable.
[ ] Make the GUI look good.
[ ] Make the GUI look great.
[ ] Make the GUI look beautiful.
